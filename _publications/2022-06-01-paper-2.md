## Abstract

College students face unprecedented mental health challenges, with increasing rates of anxiety and depression. This randomized controlled trial (N=320) evaluates the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) interventions delivered in both individual and group formats for college students with moderate to severe anxiety and depression. Participants were randomly assigned to: (1) weekly individual CBT (12 sessions), (2) group CBT (10 sessions), (3) combined individual and group CBT, or (4) waitlist control. Primary outcomes measured using GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scales showed significant improvements in the CBT conditions compared to control (p < .001). Effect sizes were moderate to large (d = 0.65-0.89). Group-based interventions proved cost-effective while maintaining efficacy. Results suggest scalable, evidence-based approaches to addressing the college mental health crisis.
