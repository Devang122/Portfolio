## Abstract

Positive psychology has emerged as a transformative field in mental health research, offering evidence-based approaches to enhance human flourishing and resilience. This systematic review synthesizes recent empirical studies (2018-2023) investigating the impact of positive psychology interventions on psychological resilience across diverse populations. Through meta-analysis of 47 randomized controlled trials involving 3,200 participants, we found significant improvements in resilience scores (Cohen's d = 0.72, p < .001). Key interventions included gratitude practices, mindfulness-based approaches, and strength-finding exercises. The findings suggest that positive psychology interventions are particularly effective when tailored to individual and cultural contexts. This review provides comprehensive evidence for integrating positive psychology into clinical practice and organizational wellness programs.

## Key Findings

- Positive psychology interventions significantly enhance psychological resilience (p < .001)
- Gratitude practices show the strongest effect sizes (d = 0.85)
- Cultural adaptation improves intervention effectiveness by 23%
- Benefits persist at 12-month follow-up assessments
